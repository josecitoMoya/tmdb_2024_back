# # Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# # This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# # You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# # database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# # https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
# services:
#   server:
#     build:
#       context: .
#     environment:
#       NODE_ENV: develop
#     ports:
#       - 3000:3000

#     # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
#     # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
#     # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
#     # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
#     # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
#     # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.

#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=tmdb_db
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
#     expose:
#       - 5432
#     healthcheck:
#       test: ["CMD", "pg_isready"]
#       interval: 10s
#       timeout: 5s
#       retries: 5
# volumes:
#   db-data:
# secrets:
#   db-password:
#     file: db/password.txt
